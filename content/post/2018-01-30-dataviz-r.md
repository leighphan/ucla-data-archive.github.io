Creating meaningful and attractive graphics is a core skill in both data exploration and communicating your findings. In this workshop, you'll gain experience in using the R package ggplot2 to make publication-quality graphics. We'll cover the vernacular of the grammar-of-graphics, the conceptual model behind ggplot2 and how to use that to build plots.
