This is monthly meet-up for the data cleaning and processing tool Open Refine.  Participants are encouraged to bring in their data, problems, questions about Open Refine, or any Open Refine tips and successes they'd like to share.  We'll also have meetings where we cover features or plugins Open Refine provides. This will be fun and supportive meet-up where we will learn together.
