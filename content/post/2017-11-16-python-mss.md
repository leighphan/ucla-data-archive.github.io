Python workshop for the [Masters of Social Science Program](http://mass.ss.ucla.edu/).

This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python for people with little or no previous programming experience. It uses plotting as its motivating example. This lesson references the Jupyter Notebook, but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as well. Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.
