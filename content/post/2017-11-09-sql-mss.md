SQL workshop for the Masters of Social Science Program

Three common options for storage are text files, spreadsheets, and databases. Text files are easiest to create, and work well with version control, but then we would have to build search and analysis tools ourselves. Spreadsheets are good for doing simple analyses, but they don’t handle large or complex data sets well. Databases, however, include powerful tools for search and analysis, and can handle large, complex data sets. These lessons will show how to use a database to explore the expeditions’ data.

## Setup


### Software

SQL is a specialized programming language used with databases.  We
use a simple database manager called [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/)
in our lessons.


We will use [SQLite Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/)
    plugin for the [Firefox web browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). If you don't have Firefox installed, you need to install it first and
    then you will be able to add the plugin.
