It is often said that data analysts spend up to 80% of their time cleaning and processing data while only 20% actually analyzing it. Learning how to clean and work with data is a critical skill. This workshop will give you a basic introduction to data preparation in R using the tidyverse (tidyR, dplyr and stringr packages). Once you complete this course you'll be able to take raw data and get it ready for your analytical powers.

Prerequisite: Some knowledge of R a must. Either attend our Intro to R course on 1/24 or work through Data Camp's Intro to R free course.

Instructor: Tim Dennis, Director of the Data Archive and Software Carpentry Instructor.
