A follow-up Open Refine class to cover some topics we didn't get to cover in the Library Carpentry on 9-8. We'll pick up on how to do more transformations in Open Refine including split and join operations. We'll then explore the wonderful world of using Open Refine to enhance our data with data from external sources, including CrossRef, Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), and WikiData. Jamie Jamison will then show us some real data sets she has used Open Refine to clean. We'll also leave time for working with data you bring.
